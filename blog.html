      <h3 style="font-style: italic;">History</h3>
      <p>
        The Cheriyal paintings were and continue to be a distinctly local invention, peculiar to the Telangana region, drawing mainly on local traditions.
        It can safely be said that the local temple art traditions and the Kalamkari tradition across Telangana in particular, and the graphic art traditions of the Deccan and South India in general were the major influences that shaped and guided the art of scroll paintings.
        The Nakashis of Telangana also made dolls, much like the Kinnal dolls of Karnataka, in addition to the painted scrolls. These scrolls were a very important part of the sociological and cultural setting of Telangana.
      </p>
      <div class="spacing"></div>
      <h3 style="font-style: italic;">About the art</h3>
      <p>
        Cheriyal paintings represent a unique local creation, based mainly on local traditions. Cheriyal Scroll Painting is a stylized version of Nakashi art, rich in the local motifs peculiar to the Telangana. They are at present made only in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The scrolls are painted in a narrative format, much like a film roll or a comic strip, depicting stories from Indian mythology, and intimately tied to the shorter stories from the Puranas and Epics.
      </p>
      <div class="spacing"></div>
      <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Painted in vivid hues, mostly primary colours, with a predominance of red in the background. </li>
        <li>The making of the canvas is a very elaborate procedure. The Khadi cotton is treated with a mixture of starch (from rice), suddha matti (white mud), a paste of boiled tamarind seeds and gum water thrice.</li>
        <li>It has to be ensured that every coating is thoroughly dried before the next one is applied. Once the canvas is ready, the artist’s sketch the outline directly onto the canvas using a brush.</li>
        <li>The outlines are very well defined and sharply reflecting the quality and experience of the craftsman. The colours are made by the artists from natural sources. </li>
        <li>Brushes are made with hair of squirrels tied to a stick. Dolls and masks are made of wood, saw dust and tamarind paste. Masks are made even with coconut shells.</li>
        <li>The costumes and settings in which the figures are depicted are typical and reflect the culture of Andhra, where these paintings originated.</li>
        <li>Within the narrow panels, proportion is created by depicting trees, or a building, a pillar with drawn curtains, etc.</li>
      </ul> 
      <div class="spacing"></div>
      <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Culture</h3>
      <p>
        The traditional art form became an inseparable part of the profession of the story-telling, balladeer community known as Kaki Padagollu. 
      </p>
      <p>
        They displayed the scrolls and accompanied by music and dance went from village to village narrating and singing their ballads based from their rich folklore which was rooted in the Puranas and Indian Epics, enlivening many a lazy village evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        The storyteller-balladeer would wander from village to village in a team of usually five people, with two to narrate the story while the others would provide a simple but hectic musical accompaniment with the harmonium, tabala and castanets.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stage would also be a simple affair erected on four poles with a horizontal bar on which the scrolls could be displayed.
      </p>
